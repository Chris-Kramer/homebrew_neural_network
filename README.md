# Homebrew Neural Network  
To challenge myself and to gain a deeper understanding og neural networks, I created my own neural networks from scratch using only pure python. That means no numpy, tensorflow, or sklearn only standard libraries are allowed in the model itself.  
However, for visualization and for datawrangling, I did use pandas and matplotlib.  
Note that this neural network is not meant to have high performance or accuracy, however, it does lay bare, how simple a neural network really can be.  
Feel free to clone this repo and expirement yourself.
