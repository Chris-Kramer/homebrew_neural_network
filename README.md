# Homebrew Neural Network  
To challenge myself and to gain a deeper understanding og neural networks, I created my own neural networks from scratch using only pure python. That means no numpy, pandas, tensorflow, or sklearn, only standard libraries are allowed.  
Note that this neural network is not meant to have high performance or accuracy, however, it does lay bare, how simple a neural network really can be.  
Feel free to clone this repo and expirement yourself.
