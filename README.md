# Homebrew Neural Network  
To challenge myself and to gain a deeper understanding og neural networks, I created my own neural networks from scratch using only pure python. That means no numpy, tensorflow, or sklearn only standard libraries are allowed in the model itself.
However, for visualization and for datawrangling, I did use pandas and matplotlib. Moreover, the data (tickets_test.csv, tickets_train.csv) is synthetic data. The model is supposed to be trained to predict if a customer will buy a ticket to a golf course, by looking at the weather, the golf course ranking, and the price.  
- **cnn.py:** This is the implementation of a convolutional neural network.
- **feed_forward.py:** This is the implementation of a feed forward network.

Note that this neural network is not meant to have high performance or accuracy, however, it does lay bare, how simple a neural network really can be.
